Python exercises taken from [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/), used by me for teaching a workshop of Python. It was originally intended only for the students at the [ROSEdu Community and Development Lab](http://cdl.rosedu.org/) in 2014, but I've used it at more events since then.

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10lZyWTD_LPKHhQbQFfUnoe2Ng45K89wTlyFxXJkQuMU/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000) that help me not forget what to show to the students.

[LightTable](http://lighttable.com/) is the recommended IDE for the course.

Use [PythonTutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) to visualize the algorithm you have written.

# Plan

The course takes two hours. The plan is:

* first present Python specific stuff from the first slide
* make a demo in the terminal and tell them about variables
* code the first function (they should code along)
* explain in the terminal strings (everything should have taken ~30 mins)
* leave them ~20 mins for `string1.py` and another ~10 mins for `string2.py`
* explain lists (~10 mins)
* `list1.py` takes around 10 mins and `list2.py` another 10 mins
* show dicts and reading from files (~10 mins)
* give them to implement `wordcount.py` if you have time, or give it as homework (~30 mins)

### Optional

* how to get the list of Facebook friends using the FacebookSDK (~15 mins)
* show them `requests` and `beautifulsoup` using the [CDL submissions scraper](https://github.com/palcu/convertor/blob/master/blog_post/parse_submissions.py) as an example (~10 mins)
* maybe show them OOP at the end and give them the [Codecademy OOP](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/python-intermediate-en-WL8e4/3/1?curriculum_id=4f89dab3d788890003000096) exercises
